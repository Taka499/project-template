# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to a coding agent when working with code in this repository.

## Documentation

Project documentation lives in `docs/`. When creating or updating plans, ExecPlans, or design docs, save them there. Reference existing docs in `docs/` for context on project phases and milestones.

Every document should be self-sufficient: the reader should never need to hunt for context. Explain concepts inline. When a concept is already defined in another checked-in document, you may reference it by file path and section rather than repeating it — but the reference must be precise enough that the reader can find it immediately (e.g., "see `docs/PLANS.md` § Milestones"), not vague ("see the architecture doc").

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `docs/PLANS.md`) from design to implementation. ExecPlans are the persistence layer for cross-session development — they carry forward all context, decisions, and progress so that a fresh session can continue the work without loss. Completed plans are immutable history; when one finishes, run the close-out ritual (`close-out` skill) to extract its durable decisions before moving on.

## Durable Decisions (ADRs)

Cross-plan decisions live in `docs/adr/` (convention: `docs/adr/README.md`). This list is an index, not a home — one line per active decision with a pointer to its ADR; full context, provenance, and lifecycle live in the ADR file. Every non-obvious claim elsewhere in this file must cite its source (`per docs/adr/NNNN` or `per docs/plans/<plan>.md`) so this snapshot stays auditable and rebuildable. When an ADR corrects something an old plan asserted, the ADR wins.

<!-- One line per accepted ADR, e.g.:
- `docs/adr/0001-example.md` — **accepted**: one-sentence statement of the decision.
-->

## Project Overview

<!-- Describe what this project does, who it serves, and what problem it solves. -->

## Architecture

<!-- Describe the high-level structure: key directories, how components relate, data flow. Name the main entry points. -->

## Setup and Development

<!-- How to install dependencies, configure the environment, and run the project locally. Include exact commands. -->

## Build and Test

<!-- List the commands to build, test, lint, and format. Show expected output for a clean run. -->

## Code Style

<!-- Language-specific conventions, naming patterns, import ordering, or formatting tools in use. -->

## Commit Discipline

- Follow Git-flow workflow to manage the branches
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
- Only add and commit affected files; leave untracked files as they are
- Never add coding agent attribution in commits
